    <about>This application allows to locate montreal public libraries, find more information about each library and search for books. The application has been developed as a part time project and is not intended to be distributed or selled. Currently only OS 5 and later are supported. The data about libraries comes from montreal open Montreal ouvert (http://montrealouvert.net/?lang=en) and for location it uses google maps APIS.
The application has no any affiliation with montreal city or any of its libraries.
